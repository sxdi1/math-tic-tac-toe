As a student at Toronto Metropolitan University who attends almost all of her lectures, I happen to see students getting bored during a lecture. This causes them to resort to several solutions: mindlessly scrolling through social media, taking naps, or simply just leaving mid-lecture! Now all of these are harmless solutions, but often times I will witness students playing games on their laptops, and it can get extremely distracting for me. The bright colours and wanting to know whether my fellow classmate will win or beat that level keeps me checking their screen more often than the powerpoint being shared by the professor. Thus Iâ€™ve decided to program a solution. A console based game that will keep students entertained without distracting me! Being console based, it eliminates the factor of bright colours that seem to catch my eye. Furthermore, this game consists of numbers and boxes, there are no levels or lives for me to keep looking back at from the back of the room.  This game is a mathematical version of tic-tac-toe and this is how it works:

Players will take turns placing numbers 1 through 9 inclusive until a row, column or diagonal adds up to 15. The only rule being that the first move placed cannot be a 5 in the middle box. The user can play against a classmate, but to avoid distracting others during the lecture, I have implemented a game mode to play against the computer.
